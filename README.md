# Rules of migrating to Next.js (/pages approach)

## Before pushing

Clear code from debugging, console.logs and so on.
Run `yarn build` before pushing, to check for TS errors absence.

## Pages

### UI

Wrap pages with similar UI that doesn't require much data from API with separate _Layout_ components in `@/layouts/{{domain}}` folder.

Example:

```jsx
const PlayersCardscorers = ({
  players: initialPlayers,
}) => {
    {...}
  return (
    <PlayersPageLayout>
    {your_remaining_ui}
    </PlayersPageLayout>
  );
};
```

### Data

Move data fetching from hooks used inside functional components to another "service" level, which will be used
both in `getServerSideProps` and client `useEffectWithoutFirstRender`.

### I18N

_use High-Order-Function `getSSPWithT` with `getServerSideProps`._
Example:

```js
export const getServerSideProps = getSSPWithT(async (ctx: NextPageContext) => {
  const [reqPromise] = getCardscorers(1);
  const players = await reqPromise.then(({ data }) => data).catch(() => []);

  return {
    props: {
      players,
    },
  };
});
```

Inside fn cmps pls use `useIntl` from "@/hooks/useIntl"
